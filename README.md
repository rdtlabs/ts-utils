# Typescript utils for async, cancellation, etc
This is currently a work in progress. 

These utils are being pulled together from a series of past projects written in both javascript and typescript. In some cases it is a full re-write of a previously useful semantic and in others it is minor updates or addition of type safe constructs. Test will be added once the base utils have been collected and pushed up. The projected date for completing the v1.0 is mid April, 2024.
