# Typescript utils for async, cancellation, etc 
This is currently a work in progress.

These utils are being pulled together from a series of past projects written in both javascript and typescript. In some cases it is a full re-write of a previously useful semantic and in others it is minor updates or addition of type safe constructs. The documentation will be updated as the project progresses. The current test coverage is not 100% complete but pretty comprehensive. That said, if your viewing this on jsr.io scrore for docs seems to be a major factor in the ranking of the project.
